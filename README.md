Spectra\_generator: python-based tool for 1H NMR spectra simulation based on official databases. 



## Spectra_generator

\- User must input .xlsx or .csv files containing metabolite names, peak parameters, and concentrations.



\- Generates realistic low- and high-field NMR spectra for each sample.



\- Optimized for urine samples, taking into account pH-dependent chemical shift variations.
